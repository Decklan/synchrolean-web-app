        Leader Standard Work are your standard tasks as a leader. 
        It is not just about the What you do; itâ€™s also about the How and the Why.

      These are the routine tasks that you do to support your Lean culture. 
      The principles of Lean are Respect and Continuous Improvement. Consider 
      daily, weekly, monthly and annual tasks that you do to drive inspiration 
      to the hearts and minds of those around you. This is done every day, every 
      week, every month and every year. It takes the form of strategic program 
      planning, initiative selection, improvement management and daily problem 
      solving coaching.
